        <li>Set aside for 30 mins to rest if you have time, or start cooking straight away.</li>
        <li>Set a medium frying pan or crêpe pan over a medium heat and carefully wipe it with some oiled kitchen paper.</li>
        <li>When hot, cook your pancakes for 1 min on each side until golden, keeping them warm in a low oven as you go.</li>
